# ZumPay™ Project Goals

The goal of the ZumPay™ project is to provide an easy to use, integrate, and maintain [Payment Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_gateway) for the ZumCoin network. Our hopes are to drive future adoption of  ZumCoin cryptocurrency by providing a standard library and service that facilitiates transactions on the network.

By making it easy for developers to integrate payment activities into their applications and e-commerce platforms, the barrier for entry into using ZumCoin as a payment method drops substanially. By removing the need for understanding the core ZumCoin software suite, maintaining the infrastructure for connecting to the network, and providing common libraries, our hope is that more developers will integrate the technology into their platforms.

Building on the technology and platform we hope to design, our hope is that we will be able to develop a platform that competes with other networked payment methods such as:

* [ApplePay](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/)
* [GooglePay](https://pay.google.com/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Paypal](https://paypal.com/)
* And countless other platforms...

Our journey is not a short one by any means and the effort required to build a secure, safe, and stable platform is substantial. We welcome the involvement, review, and feedback of ZumCoin users and developers, and the extended cryptocurrency community, as we continue to design, implement, and support the ZumPay™ project.
